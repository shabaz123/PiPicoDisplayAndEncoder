# PiPicoDisplayAndEncoder

The Python code here controls a display, based on input from a rotary encoder and an optional button for setting the step value. The code accelerates the change in value if the rotary encoder is turned rapidly.

See 1-minute video demonstration here: https://youtu.be/WMhKXgpH30o

To run the code, install CircuitPython on your Pi Pico, and then just drag the Python code.py file into the Pi Pico CircuitPython USB drive letter that appears.
